#Starlight Discord bot

I wrote a personal bot for my Discord server. 
Its original purpose was to provide realtime music streaming to a given voice channel.
I am looking to expand its purpose past playing music.
I am exploring any practical use my bot can provide for me and my friends.


#Starlight is a work in progress

I wanted a personal Discord bot for my server because I wanted to make my server seem more
intentional/personal. I also wanted to cut down on functionalities that other Discord bots provided while exploring possible future functions. I wanted to create a bot that is useful for those in the server playing League of Legends and is great for lounging around for those people who are not playing LoL.


#Starlight is still in its infancy stage

As of right now, Starlight only plays music. 
I am the only one working on it, too.
